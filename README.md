# Basic-Crack-Detector
# Introduction
This task focuses on automating structural inspection by utilizing images for 3D reconstruction and detecting defects, specifically cracks, without the use of artificial neural networks (ANNs). 
It's a project that employs traditional methods rather than ANN-based approaches, with the primary goal of ensuring the safety of structures.
